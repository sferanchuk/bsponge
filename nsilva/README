The program 'silvabact' is developed to re-cluster raw silva database using uclust algorithm.
The aim is to prepare the reference database, which could be used with test_otu pipeline for open-refence otu clustering.
The uclust program is called from within the main program, to re-cluster provided sequences at a given level of similarity.

Command 'g++ -O2 -o silvabact silvabact.cpp' could be used to comile a software.
To run the program, 32-bit version of 'usearch' program (https://drive5.com/usearch/) should be available in $PATH directories, 
named as 'uclust' - as it is available in the distribution of QIIME package.
Raw Silva database could be downloaded from https://www.arb-silva.de in arb format
It should be converted to plain text format using 'arb' software (http://www.arb-home.de)

Ather that, the database could be processed with the command './silvabact raw_silva.txt nsilva'
This will give two output files in fasta format with 'nsilva' prefix.
Aligned sequences are in one of the output files and plain sequences without gaps are in another file.
Both files will contain the taxonomy description of each reference sequence.
The silva assignents of taxonomy are normally used. 

In some cases, where the fine taxonomic divisions of some class are undefined in the source database, 
the divisions are assigned de-novo using anonymous identifiers.
As the example, identifier 'getu_55' stands for some cluster of sequences within a higher taxonomic division
which could putatively described as an unknown genus within that division.
'uclust' program with the specified identity threshold used to separate that kinds of clusters.
